============================================
🚀 BUILD SIGNED APK FOR YOUR COLLEAGUES
============================================

YOUR GOAL:

Create app-release.apk that colleagues can install
on their Android phones without errors.

YOUR SETUP (VERIFIED):
----------------------

============================================
HOW TO BUILD (ONE COMMAND!):
============================================

Double-click this file:

    📁 BUILD-SIGNED-RELEASE-APK.bat

That's it!

============================================
WHAT HAPPENS:
============================================

1. Script checks Android SDK location ✓

2. Creates signing key (first time only)
   - You'll enter a password
   - Save this password!
   
3. Builds signed release APK
   - Takes 3-5 minutes
   - Creates: app-release.apk

4. Opens folder with your APK
   - Ready to share!

============================================
FIRST TIME: CREATE SIGNING KEY
============================================

You'll be asked for:

1. Keystore password (choose strong password!)
2. Your name
3. Organization (e.g., "ACU")
4. City
5. State/Province
6. Country code (e.g., "PH")

⚠️  WRITE DOWN THE PASSWORD!
    You'll need it for every future build!

⚠️  DON'T LOSE: acu-project-map.jks
    This file signs your app!

============================================
SHARE WITH COLLEAGUES:
============================================

After build completes:

1. Find: app-release.apk

2. Share it:
   - Email
   - USB drive  
   - Cloud storage
   - Network share

3. Colleagues install on Android phones

4. Done! ✅

============================================
COLLEAGUES: HOW TO INSTALL
============================================

1. Transfer app-release.apk to phone

2. Tap the APK file

3. Enable "Unknown Sources" if asked

4. Tap "Install"

5. Tap "Open"

6. Use the app!

No errors! Properly signed! ✅

============================================
FUTURE UPDATES:
============================================

When you update the app:

1. Make code changes

2. Run: BUILD-SIGNED-RELEASE-APK.bat

3. Enter SAME password as before

4. Get new app-release.apk

5. Share with colleagues

They install over old version!

============================================
WHERE IS THE APK?
============================================

Full path:
C:\Users\edujk\Desktop\project map\acu-project-map-123456-789\android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk

The script opens this folder automatically!

============================================
APK FILE SIZE:
============================================

Typical size: 15-25 MB

If it's tiny (few KB), something went wrong!

============================================
IMPORTANT FILES TO SAVE:
============================================

✓ acu-project-map.jks (signing key)
✓ Your password (write it down!)
✓ app-release.apk (the final APK)

Backup acu-project-map.jks somewhere safe!

============================================

If build fails:

1. Open Android Studio

2. File > Open > Select "android" folder

3. Let it sync (download components)

4. Run script again

============================================
READY TO BUILD?
