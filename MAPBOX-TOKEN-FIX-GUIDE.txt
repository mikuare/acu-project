🗺️ MAPBOX TOKEN MISSING - COMPLETE FIX
============================================

PROBLEM:
--------
✗ APK installs successfully
✗ App opens but shows "Mapbox token is missing"
✗ No map visible on Android device

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The Mapbox token wasn't included in the APK build.
The token was being read from environment variables
which don't exist in production builds.

SOLUTION:
---------
✓ Changed to use hardcoded configuration
✓ Created: src/config/mapbox.ts
✓ Updated: PhilippinesMapMapbox.tsx
✓ Now token will be included in APK!

============================================
🔧 WHAT I CHANGED:
============================================

1. Created: src/config/mapbox.ts
   - New config file for Mapbox token
   - Works in both development and production
   - Similar to how Supabase is configured

2. Updated: src/components/PhilippinesMapMapbox.tsx
   - Now imports from config file
   - No longer relies on .env variables
   - Will work in APK builds

============================================
📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW:
============================================

STEP 1: Get Your Mapbox Token (5 minutes)
------------------------------------------
→ Read: GET-MAPBOX-TOKEN.txt
→ Or go directly to: https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/
→ Sign up (FREE, no credit card needed)
→ Copy your "Default public token"
→ It looks like: pk.eyJ1abc123xyz...

STEP 2: Add Token to Config File
---------------------------------
→ Double-click: ADD-MAPBOX-TOKEN.bat
→ This opens: src/config/mapbox.ts in Notepad
→ Replace 'YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN_HERE' with your token
→ Save (Ctrl+S) and close

Example:
BEFORE:
export const MAPBOX_TOKEN = 'YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN_HERE';

AFTER:
export const MAPBOX_TOKEN = 'pk.eyJ1IjoibXl1c2VybmFtZSIsImEiOiJjbHh5ejEyMzQifQ.abc123xyz';

STEP 3: Rebuild APK
-------------------
→ Double-click: REBUILD-WITH-MAPBOX.bat
→ Wait 5-10 minutes
→ Get new APK with Mapbox working!

STEP 4: Test on Android
------------------------
→ Install the new app-release.apk
→ Open the app
→ Map should now be visible! 🗺️

============================================
🎯 QUICK START (IF YOU HAVE TOKEN):
============================================

If you already have a Mapbox token:

1. Edit: src\config\mapbox.ts
   - Add your token

2. Run: REBUILD-WITH-MAPBOX.bat
   - Builds new APK

3. Install on Android
   - Test the map!

============================================
📱 VERIFICATION:
============================================

After installing the new APK:

✓ App opens successfully
✓ Map tiles load and display
✓ Project markers show on map
✓ Can zoom and pan the map
✓ Can tap markers to see details

If map still doesn't show:
→ Check token format (must start with "pk.")
→ Verify token is valid at mapbox.com
→ Make sure you saved the file correctly
→ Rebuild again with REBUILD-WITH-MAPBOX.bat

============================================
💡 WHY THIS APPROACH:
============================================

Environment Variables (.env):
✗ Don't work in production builds
✗ Not included in APK
✗ Only for development

Hardcoded Config:
✓ Works in all environments
✓ Included in APK automatically
✓ Same as Supabase config
✓ Professional approach

Mapbox tokens are PUBLIC:
✓ Safe to include in app
✓ Meant for client-side use
✓ Can be seen in browser/app (normal!)
✓ Protected by usage limits

============================================
🆓 MAPBOX FREE TIER:
============================================

✓ 50,000 map loads per month
✓ No credit card required
✓ Perfect for your project
✓ Upgrade later if needed

For your use case (colleagues only):
→ Free tier is MORE than enough!
