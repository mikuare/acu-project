============================================
❓ WHY DIDN'T THE ICON CHANGE?
============================================

PROBLEM:
--------
You ran UPDATE-ANDROID-ICON.bat
Installed APK and restarted device
But icon still shows default (⚡) not earth logo (🌍)

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
-----------------
Capacitor's automatic icon sync doesn't always work
properly. It tries to copy icons from PWA manifest
but sometimes fails or creates wrong sizes.

Common reasons:
✓ Icon format not compatible
✓ Sizes not generated correctly
✓ Manifest path issue
✓ Capacitor version issue

SOLUTION: Use manual methods instead! ✓
