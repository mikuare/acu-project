SIMPLE BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
============================================

I created 2 new scripts to help you:

============================================
STEP 1: Check Your Setup
============================================

Double-click: CHECK-SETUP.bat

This will verify:
✓ Java is installed
✓ Node.js is installed  
✓ Keystore file exists
✓ Configuration is correct
✓ Android project ready

If any [ERROR] shows, fix it first!

============================================
STEP 2: Build Your APK
============================================

Double-click: BUILD-APK-SIMPLE.bat

This will:
1. Check keystore exists
2. Build web app
3. Sync to Android
4. Build signed APK
5. Open folder with APK

Wait 5-10 minutes.

============================================
WHAT TO TELL ME:
============================================

If VERIFY-AND-BUILD.bat didn't work, please tell me:

1. What error message did you see?
2. Did it show any text at all?
3. Did a window open and close immediately?

This helps me fix it for you!

============================================
TRY THESE IN ORDER:
============================================

1. Run: CHECK-SETUP.bat
   - Shows if everything is ready
   - Copy/paste the output to me if errors

2. Run: BUILD-APK-SIMPLE.bat
   - Simpler version that avoids PowerShell issues
   - Should work even if VERIFY-AND-BUILD.bat didn't

============================================
LOCATION OF YOUR FILES:
============================================

Keystore should be at:
C:\Users\edujk\Desktop\project map\acu-project-map-123456-789\android\keystores\release-key.jks

APK will be created at:
C:\Users\edujk\Desktop\project map\acu-project-map-123456-789\android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk

============================================
COMMON ISSUES:
============================================

Issue 1: Window opens and closes immediately
Fix: Run CHECK-SETUP.bat to see what's wrong

Issue 2: "npm is not recognized"
Fix: PowerShell blocking - BUILD-APK-SIMPLE.bat should fix this

Issue 3: "Keystore not found"
Fix: Check if android\keystores\release-key.jks exists

Issue 4: "Access denied" or "Permission denied"
Fix: Right-click script, select "Run as administrator"

============================================
NEXT STEPS:
============================================

1. Run: CHECK-SETUP.bat

2. Tell me what it shows (copy/paste the output)

3. Then we'll fix any issues and build your APK!
