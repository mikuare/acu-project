============================================
‚úÖ SIGNING CONFIGURATION FIXED!
============================================

PROBLEM:
--------
‚úó APK was being built as "app-release-unsigned.apk"
‚úó Signing config was missing from build.gradle

SOLUTION:
---------
‚úì Added signing configuration to android/app/build.gradle
‚úì Linked keystore credentials from gradle.properties
‚úì Added Java 17 compatibility
‚úì APK will now be properly SIGNED!

============================================
üöÄ BUILD YOUR SIGNED APK NOW:
============================================

Since your web app is already built,
just run the quick rebuild:

    Double-click: REBUILD-SIGNED-APK.bat

This will:
1. ‚úì Sync to Android (30 seconds)
2. ‚úì Build SIGNED APK (3-5 minutes)
3. ‚úì Open folder with APK

Total time: ~5 minutes

============================================
‚úÖ WHAT YOU'LL GET:
============================================

File: android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk

‚úì Properly SIGNED (not unsigned!)
‚úì Using your keystore (Judech-123)
‚úì No parse errors when installing
‚úì Ready to share with colleagues
‚úì Professional release build

============================================
üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S SIGNED:
============================================

After the build completes:

1. Go to: android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\
2. Check the filename

‚úì GOOD: app-release.apk (SIGNED!)
‚úó BAD: app-release-unsigned.apk (not signed)

If you see "app-release.apk" with NO "-unsigned"
= SUCCESS! It's properly signed! üéâ

============================================
üìã WHAT WAS CHANGED:
============================================

File: android/app/build.gradle

Added:
1. signingConfigs section
   - Reads keystore from gradle.properties
   - Uses your password & alias
   
2. signingConfig in release buildType
   - Applies signing to release builds
   
3. Java 17 compatibility
   - sourceCompatibility
   - targetCompatibility

============================================
‚ö° NEXT STEP:
============================================

Double-click: REBUILD-SIGNED-APK.bat

Wait 5 minutes for your SIGNED APK! üöÄ

============================================
üì± SHARE WITH COLLEAGUES:
============================================

Once built:

1. Copy: android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
2. Send to colleagues (WhatsApp, email, etc.)
3. They can install directly on Android!

Installation steps for them:
1. Transfer APK to phone
2. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Settings
3. Tap the APK file
4. Tap "Install"
5. Done! ‚úì

============================================
üí° FOR FUTURE UPDATES:
============================================

When you update your app:

1. Make code changes
2. Run: BUILD-APK-COMPLETE.bat
3. Get new SIGNED app-release.apk
4. Share with colleagues
5. They can update the existing app

The keystore is already configured!
Everything will be signed automatically!

============================================
‚ùì IF YOU SEE UNSIGNED AGAIN:
============================================

If it still creates "app-release-unsigned.apk":

1. Check android/gradle.properties has:
   RELEASE_STORE_FILE=../keystores/release-key.jks
   RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=Judech-123
   RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=acu-project-map-key
   RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=Judech-123

2. Check keystore exists:
   android\keystores\release-key.jks

3. Tell me and copy/paste the build output

============================================
üéØ BUILD NOW:
============================================

Double-click: REBUILD-SIGNED-APK.bat

Then check the filename in the folder!

If it says "app-release.apk" (no "-unsigned")
= You're DONE! Share it! üéâ
