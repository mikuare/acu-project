Solution Applied:
-----------------
✓ Created: src/config/mapbox.ts
✓ Added your token: pk.eyJ1IjoianVkZWNoLTEyMyI...
✓ Updated: PhilippinesMapMapbox.tsx to import from config
✓ Token now included in APK build

Status: FIXED ✅

============================================
📋 ISSUE #2: NO PERMISSION DIALOGS
============================================

Problem:
--------
❌ Location permission not requested
❌ Camera permission not requested
❌ Users couldn't use GPS or camera
❌ Works as PWA but not in APK

Solution Applied:
-----------------
✓ Added Android permissions to AndroidManifest.xml
✓ Installed @capacitor/geolocation plugin
✓ Installed @capacitor/camera plugin
✓ Created permission utilities
✓ Updated map component

Status: FIXED ✅

============================================
📋 ISSUE #3: GPS "NO VALID DETECTION"
============================================

Problem:

❌ Users got error: "no valid detection within Philippines"
❌ Even with location ENABLED!
❌ 10-second timeout too short
❌ Accuracy requirements too strict (≤150m only)

   → Use config files instead

2. Android Permissions:
   → Need AndroidManifest.xml declarations
   → Need Capacitor plugins for runtime requests
   → Native dialogs are automatic

3. Mobile GPS:
   → Needs 20-30 seconds (cold start)
   → Accuracy varies: 5m (outdoor) to 500m (indoor)
   → Be lenient with accuracy thresholds
   → Give users feedback

4. APK Signing:
   → Prevents parse errors
   → Required for distribution
   → Keep keystore safe!
