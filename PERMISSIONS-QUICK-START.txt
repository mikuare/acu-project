📍 QUICK START: ADD PERMISSIONS TO APK
============================================

PROBLEM:
--------

SOLUTION:
---------
Build new APK with proper Android permissions!

🎯 WHAT I CHANGED FOR YOU:

============================================
📱 HOW IT WORKS NOW:
============================================

When colleagues install and use the APK:

STEP 1: Open app
→ App loads, map displays ✓

STEP 2: Tap "Enter Project"
→ Android permission dialog appears:
  "Allow ACU Project Map to access location?"
  [WHILE USING APP]  [ONLY THIS TIME]  [DENY]

STEP 3: Tap "While using the app"
→ Permission granted! ✓

STEP 4: GPS location obtained
→ User can enter project ✓

STEP 5: Use camera (if needed)
→ Camera permission dialog appears
→ User taps "Allow"
→ Camera works! ✓

============================================
🚀 BUILD NOW:

The new APK will have:

============================================
📋 TESTING:

1. Install app-release.apk on Android
2. Open the app
3. Tap "Enter Project"
4. ✓ Permission dialog should appear!
5. Tap "Allow"
6. ✓ GPS should work!

============================================
❓ QUICK HELP:
============================================

Permission dialog doesn't appear?
→ May already be granted
→ Check: Settings > Apps > ACU Project Map > Permissions

Location not working?
→ Enable device GPS/location
→ Go outdoors for better signal
→ Or use "Pin on Map" feature

Camera not working?
→ Check camera permission
→ Make sure camera not open in background
