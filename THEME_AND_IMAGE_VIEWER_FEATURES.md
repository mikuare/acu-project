# Theme Toggle & Enhanced Image Viewer Features

## ðŸŽ¨ New Features Implemented

### 1. **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**
Added a beautiful theme switcher that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes throughout the entire application.

#### Files Created:
- **`src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`**: Context provider for managing theme state across the app
  - Saves theme preference to localStorage
  - Detects system preference on first load
  - Applies theme classes to the root HTML element

- **`src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`**: Reusable theme toggle button component
  - Displays sun icon for dark mode, moon icon for light mode
  - Smooth icon transitions
  - Accessible with tooltips

#### Files Modified:
- **`src/App.tsx`**: Wrapped the entire app with `ThemeProvider`
- **`src/pages/Index.tsx`**: Added theme toggle to the main page header
- **`src/pages/admin/Dashboard.tsx`**: Added theme toggle to the admin dashboard header

#### How It Works:
- Click the sun/moon icon in the header to toggle between themes
- Theme preference is automatically saved and persists across sessions
- All UI components automatically adapt to the selected theme using Tailwind's dark mode
