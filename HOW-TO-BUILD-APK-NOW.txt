üöÄ HOW TO BUILD YOUR APK NOW
============================================

You had TWO errors:
1. ‚ùå Missing Java settings
2. ‚ùå Trying to use Java 21 (you have Java 17)

BOTH ARE NOW FIXED! ‚úÖ

============================================
üìç WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:
============================================

1. Close Android Studio (if open)

2. Double-click this file:
   
   ‚≠ê CLEAN-AND-BUILD.bat ‚≠ê

3. Wait 5-10 minutes

4. A folder will open with your APK!

5. Look for: app-release.apk

6. Copy to your Android phone

7. Install and test!

============================================
‚ö° WHY USE "CLEAN-AND-BUILD.bat"?
============================================

Because Gradle cached old files with wrong Java settings.

This script:
- Stops Gradle
- Deletes ALL old build files
- Rebuilds everything fresh with Java 17
- Creates your APK

============================================
üì± WHERE IS THE APK?
============================================

After successful build:

android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk

The script will open this folder automatically!

============================================
‚úÖ WHAT WAS FIXED:
============================================

I updated 4 files to force Java 17:

1. android/app/build.gradle
2. android/build.gradle
3. android/gradle.properties
4. android/variables.gradle

Now everything uses Java 17 consistently!

============================================
üêõ IF IT STILL FAILS:
============================================

Check your Java version:
java -version

Should say: "17.0.x" or higher

If it says "21.0.x", you need to:
1. Install Java 17 from: https://adoptium.net/
2. Set JAVA_HOME to Java 17 folder
3. Try again

============================================
üéØ READY?
============================================

Double-click: CLEAN-AND-BUILD.bat

Let it run, grab a coffee, come back to your APK! ‚òï
