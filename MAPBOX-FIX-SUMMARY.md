# üó∫Ô∏è Mapbox Token Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

Your signed APK was building successfully, but when installed on Android devices, it showed:
```
"Mapbox token is missing"
```

The map would not display, even though everything else worked.

## Root Cause

The Mapbox token was being read from **environment variables** (`import.meta.env.VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`), which:
- ‚ùå Don't exist in production builds
- ‚ùå Aren't included in the APK
- ‚ùå Only work during development

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made:

1. **Created: `src/config/mapbox.ts`**
   - New configuration file for Mapbox token
   - Similar approach to Supabase configuration
   - Token will be bundled with the app
   - Works in both development and production

2. **Updated: `src/components/PhilippinesMapMapbox.tsx`**
   - Changed from: `import.meta.env.VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`
   - Changed to: `import { MAPBOX_TOKEN } from '@/config/mapbox'`
   - Updated error message to point to new config file

### Why This Works:

‚úì **Hardcoded config** gets included in the build  
‚úì **Same approach** as Supabase credentials  
‚úì **Works everywhere** - development, production, APK  
‚úì **Mapbox tokens are PUBLIC** - safe to include in app  

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Get Your FREE Mapbox Token

Option A - Use the script:
```batch
OPEN-MAPBOX-SIGNUP.bat
```

Option B - Manual:
1. Go to: https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/
2. Sign up (FREE, no credit card needed)
3. After login, copy your "Default public token"
4. It looks like: `pk.eyJ1abc123xyz...`

### Step 2: Add Token to Config

Option A - Use the script:
```batch
ADD-MAPBOX-TOKEN.bat
```

Option B - Manual:
1. Open: `src/config/mapbox.ts`
2. Find: `export const MAPBOX_TOKEN = 'YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN_HERE';`
3. Replace with: `export const MAPBOX_TOKEN = 'pk.eyJ1abc123...';`
4. Save the file

### Step 3: Rebuild APK

```batch
REBUILD-WITH-MAPBOX.bat
```

This will:
- Build web app (with token included)
- Sync to Android
- Build signed APK
- Open folder with APK

### Step 4: Test

1. Install the new `app-release.apk` on Android
2. Open the app
3. Map should now display! üó∫Ô∏è

| `MAPBOX-TOKEN-FIX-GUIDE.txt` | Complete detailed guide |
| `GET-MAPBOX-TOKEN.txt` | How to get your token |
| `OPEN-MAPBOX-SIGNUP.bat` | Opens signup page in browser |
| `ADD-MAPBOX-TOKEN.bat` | Opens config file for editing |
| `REBUILD-WITH-MAPBOX.bat` | Rebuilds APK with token |
| `src/config/mapbox.ts` | Config file (add token here) |

## Quick Start

If you just want to fix it fast:

```batch
1. OPEN-MAPBOX-SIGNUP.bat    (get token)
2. ADD-MAPBOX-TOKEN.bat       (add token)
3. REBUILD-WITH-MAPBOX.bat    (rebuild APK)
4. Install new APK            (test!)
```

## Verification

After installing the new APK, you should see:

‚úì App opens successfully  
‚úì Map tiles load and display  
‚úì Project markers show on map  
‚úì Can zoom and pan the map  
‚úì Can tap markers for details  
‚úì No "token missing" error  

## Troubleshooting

### Map still doesn't show?

1. **Check token format**: Must start with `pk.`
2. **Verify token is valid**: Login to mapbox.com and check
3. **Check file saved**: Make sure you saved `mapbox.ts` after editing
4. **Rebuild again**: Run `REBUILD-WITH-MAPBOX.bat` again
5. **Check for typos**: Token must be exact, including all characters

### Build fails?

1. **Syntax error**: Check `src/config/mapbox.ts` syntax:
   ```typescript
   export const MAPBOX_TOKEN = 'pk.your_token_here';
   ```
2. **Missing quotes**: Token must be in single quotes `'...'`
3. **Missing semicolon**: Must end with `;`

## About Mapbox Tokens

### Is it safe to include in APK?

‚úÖ **YES!** Mapbox tokens are **public tokens** (start with `pk.`)
- They're **meant** to be used in client-side apps
- They're **visible** in browser/app code (this is normal)
- They're **protected** by usage limits on your Mapbox account
- It's the **standard** way to use Mapbox in mobile apps

### Free Tier

- ‚úÖ 50,000 map loads per month
- ‚úÖ No credit card required
- ‚úÖ Perfect for internal company use
- ‚úÖ More than enough for your colleagues

## Future Updates

Once you add the token:
- ‚úì It stays in the config file
- ‚úì No need to add it again
- ‚úì Future APK builds will include it automatically
- ‚úì Just run `BUILD-APK-COMPLETE.bat` for updates

## Technical Details

### Before:
```typescript
// PhilippinesMapMapbox.tsx
const MAPBOX_TOKEN = import.meta.env.VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN || '';
```
‚ùå Reads from environment variable (not in APK)

### After:
```typescript
// PhilippinesMapMapbox.tsx
import { MAPBOX_TOKEN } from '@/config/mapbox';
```
‚úÖ Imports from config file (included in APK)

```typescript
// src/config/mapbox.ts
export const MAPBOX_TOKEN = 'pk.eyJ1abc123...';
```
‚úÖ Hardcoded in config (bundled with app)

## Why This Happened

In web development, it's common to use `.env` files for configuration. However:

1. **Development**: Vite reads `.env` and injects values ‚Üí Works! ‚úÖ
2. **Web Production**: Build process includes values ‚Üí Works! ‚úÖ
3. **Mobile APK**: No `.env` file to read ‚Üí Fails! ‚ùå

Solution: Use hardcoded config file instead (like Supabase credentials).

## Summary

| Issue | Status |

| APK builds but no map | ‚úÖ FIXED |
| Mapbox token missing | ‚úÖ FIXED |
| Configuration method | ‚úÖ UPDATED |
| Scripts created | ‚úÖ READY |
| Instructions provided | ‚úÖ COMPLETE |
