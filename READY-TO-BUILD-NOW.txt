============================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
============================================

If build fails:

1. Check error message in command window

2. Most common issue:
   - Android Studio needs to download components
   - Open: android folder in Android Studio
   - Let it sync (download components)
   - Close Android Studio
   - Run BUILD-SIGNED-APK-AUTOMATED.bat again

3. If "SDK location not found":
   - Run: FIND-ANDROID-SDK.bat first
   - Then run BUILD-SIGNED-APK-AUTOMATED.bat

============================================
YOUR CREDENTIALS (SAVED):
============================================

See file: YOUR-KEYSTORE-INFO.txt

Keystore: android\keystores\release-key.jks
Password: Judech-123

‚ö†Ô∏è  BACKUP THESE FILES:
- release-key.jks (the keystore)
- YOUR-KEYSTORE-INFO.txt (your credentials)

============================================
FUTURE UPDATES:
============================================

When you want to update the app:

1. Make your code changes

2. Run: BUILD-SIGNED-APK-AUTOMATED.bat

3. It uses the SAME keystore automatically

4. Get new app-release.apk

5. Share with colleagues

6. They install over old version (updates it!)

No need to uninstall! Updates seamlessly!

============================================
READY?
============================================

Double-click:

    VERIFY-AND-BUILD.bat

Then wait 5-8 minutes for your APK!

This script will:
‚úì Verify keystore exists
‚úì Verify configuration is correct
‚úì Build your signed APK

============================================
VERIFICATION:
============================================

After build completes:

1. Check file exists:
   android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk

2. Check file size:
   Should be ~15-25 MB
   (If tiny, something went wrong)

3. Test installation:
   Install on YOUR Android phone first
   If it works for you, it'll work for colleagues!

============================================
SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:
============================================

Command window shows:
‚úÖ BUILD SUCCESSFUL!
‚úÖ Your SIGNED release APK is ready!
‚úÖ Opening output folder...

Folder opens showing:
üì¶ app-release.apk

Install on phone:
‚úÖ Installs without errors
‚úÖ App runs perfectly
‚úÖ Ready to share!

============================================
üéØ ONE MORE TIME:
============================================

TO BUILD: Run VERIFY-AND-BUILD.bat

WAIT: ~5-8 minutes

GET: app-release.apk

SHARE: With your colleagues!

DONE: They install and use! ‚úÖ

============================================
WHAT WAS FIXED:
============================================

Issue: Keystore path was wrong
Fix: Updated android/gradle.properties
      RELEASE_STORE_FILE=../keystores/release-key.jks

Now it correctly finds your keystore at:
android/keystores/release-key.jks ‚úì
