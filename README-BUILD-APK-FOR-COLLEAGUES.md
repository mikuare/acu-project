# 🚀 Build Signed Release APK for Your Colleagues

## ✅ Your Setup (Confirmed)

- ✅ **Java 17** installed
- ✅ **Android Studio** installed  
- ✅ **Capacitor 6** configured (Java 17 compatible)
- ✅ **Project location**: `C:\Users\edujk\Desktop\project map\acu-project-map-123456-789`

---

## 🎯 Your Goal

Build a **SIGNED RELEASE APK** that your colleagues can install on their Android phones without any "parse package error".

---

## 🚀 QUICK START (3 Steps)

### **Step 1: Run the Build Script** ⭐

**Double-click:** `BUILD-SIGNED-RELEASE-APK.bat`

### **Step 2: Create Signing Key (One-Time)**

The script will guide you to create a signing key. You'll be asked for:

1. **Keystore password** - Choose a strong password (you'll need this for future builds!)
2. **Your name** (e.g., "ACU Developer")
3. **Organization** (e.g., "ACU")
4. **City** (e.g., "Manila")
5. **State/Province** (e.g., "Metro Manila")
6. **Country code** (e.g., "PH")

⚠️ **SAVE THIS INFORMATION!** You'll need it for every app update!

### **Step 3: Get Your APK!**

The script will:
- Build your signed APK
- Open the folder with the APK file
- Show you the file: `app-release.apk`

---

## 📱 Distribute to Colleagues

### **Share the APK**

1. Find: `android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk`
2. Share via:
   - Email
   - USB drive
   - Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
   - Company network share

### **Installation Instructions for Colleagues**

1. **Transfer APK** to Android phone
2. **Open the APK file**
3. **Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"** if prompted
4. **Tap "Install"**
5. **Tap "Open"** to launch the app!

✅ No "parse package error" - it's properly signed!

---

## 🔧 Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `acu-project-map.jks` | **Signing key** (SAVE THIS!) |
| `app-release.apk` | **The APK to distribute** |
| `android/gradle.properties` | Build configuration |
| `android/local.properties` | SDK location |

---

## 💾 IMPORTANT: Save Your Signing Key!

After building, you'll have a file: `acu-project-map.jks`

**⚠️ CRITICAL:**
- **Backup this file** to a safe location
- **Remember your password**
- **Never lose these!**

**Why?** You need them to build future updates. If lost, you cannot update the app - you'd have to create a completely new app!

---

## 🔄 Future Updates

When you update your app:

1. Make your code changes
2. **Run:** `BUILD-SIGNED-RELEASE-APK.bat`
3. Enter the **same password** as before
4. Get updated `app-release.apk`
5. Distribute to colleagues

---

## 📊 APK Details

Your APK will be compatible with:

- **Minimum Android**: 6.0 (API 23)
- **Target Android**: 14 (API 34)
- **Architecture**: All (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86, x86_64)
- **Signature**: V1 + V2 (compatible with all devices)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Build Fails:**

1. **Open the project in Android Studio:**
   ```
   File > Open > Select: android folder
   ```

2. **Let Android Studio sync:**
   - Wait for "Gradle sync" to complete
   - It will download required components

3. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```
   Build > Clean Project
   Build > Rebuild Project
   ```

4. **Try the script again:**
   ```
   BUILD-SIGNED-RELEASE-APK.bat
   ```

### **"Parse Package Error" on Installation:**

This should NOT happen with a properly signed APK. If it does:

- Make sure you're sharing the file from: `android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk`
- **Don't share the debug APK** (from `debug` folder)
- File might be corrupted during transfer - try re-sharing

### **"App Not Installed" Error:**

- **Uninstall** any previous version of the app first
- Then install the new APK

---

## ✅ Verification

To verify your APK is properly signed:

### **Method 1: Check File Size**
- Signed APK: ~15-25 MB
- If it's tiny (few KB), something went wrong

### **Method 2: Install on Your Phone First**
- Test the APK on your own Android phone
- If it installs without errors, it's good to distribute!

### **Method 3: Check with jarsigner (Advanced)**
```bash
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```

Should show: "jar verified"
